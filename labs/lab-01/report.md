1. The 10 criteria of Open Source Definition are very important to know and understand. Many people, when hearing Open Source, believe it just means that the source code is available to the user. This is a part of Open Source but far from the entire definition. Some of these other criteria are free redistributiuon, the license must not discriminate, the license must not be product specific, along with other very important criteria that define Open Source.
2. When asking a technical question to a peer it is very important that you ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just needs help with this specific issue. Before asking, you should search everywhere you can such as online, in the manual, FAQ pages, and other references, for the answer. This is important because whoever is helping may be less inclined to help if they don't believe you tried yourself. It is also important to take your time understanding the probelm you are asking about. It can make it difficult to impossible for the person to help if you supply them with false information or an improperly formed question. This includes thoroughly detailing the problem and supplying only the symptoms of the problem, not your guesses on what the problem could be. Being polite and asking the correct person or on the correct forum is also very important for you to get the help you need in the fastest and most accurate way.
3. Don't just give them the answer - If you understand and can fix the problem, before just giving it to the user, try to help lead them to solve it themselves so they can better learn how to fix the issue next time.
Be Patient - Even though you just started looking at the problem, someone could have been working on it for a long time and become very frustrated with it. We have certainly all been there and need to understand that this can cause anger from a user.
4. Jesse Jordan was a normal college student that found an interesting problem to work on. He wanted to take RPI's network and increase the functionality of the search engine to make it useable. He succeeded in his project and it caused many more students to start using it much more often. These other students caused many more files to be added to the network, including thousands of pirated music files. Once the RIAA heard about this they were able to sue Jesse for over $15,000,000. This caused a large debate whether Jesse did anything wrong. When updating the server, he never pursuaded people in any way to upload music at all and did not upload any pirated files himself. Even though he did not have these intentions, "his" server was what enabled this "illegal" activity. If this is looked at as Jesse's fault, shouldn't we use this idea of blaming the creator in other fields? If person 1 were to start a business and sell it to person 2, and person 2 decides to use it for trafficking money or commit fraud, person 1 should be penalized as they were the one to create the business that allowed these others to commit these illegal activities. When reading this example it seems to make absolutely no sense as person 1 had no current involvement at the time of the illegal activites. However this could be said about Jesse as well. He updated the server and allowed others to use it for their own purposes. If these users decide to do anything against the law it should not be on Jesse, but the specific user.

## 6. Reflection
The project I chose to evaluate was the 500 lines or less "Blockcode: A visual programming toolkit" by Dethe Elza. The goal of this project was to implement a block language for turtle graphics using as simple a structure of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as possible. A major problem with this implementation is it does not allow the user to create adn define their own variables. This very much hinders the possibilities of this application. Currently, the only way to loop a function is to use the "repeat" block and put in a positive integer. This would cause the user to have to manually add every turn and move required rather than using a loop and adjusting the variables inside. Based on the artice, it does not seem like adding this functionality would add many problems. A set and get block could be created to define and use a variable and a global arraylist could be used to store these variables. The article mentions using two paremeters in a block would add a significant amount of code which would prevent the user from naming their variable and defining it at the same time. This could be worked past by either having the user seperate the two values in some way and taking that as a string to parse when used. A slightly easier way to work around this would be to implement a generic naming convention that is automatically applied when defined.
