# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

## Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?  
It is very important to choose a License because that is what details what freedoms the user has after acquiring the product. The license will state how the user is able to use, modify, and distribute your product. Without one of these open source licenses, the user would not be able to use your product because they would not have any legal right to do so.

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?  
It is important to not use a project that does not have a license because the user would have no right to do so. The License is what tells the user what they are allowed to do with that project when using, editing, or distributing it. If there is no license on the project a user wants to use, they do not have any legal right to do anything with that project.

## Do you agree with this claim?  
Yes I absolutely agree with the claim made in this part of the article. Releasing software earlier in the development process is much more beneficial for the project. It allows many more users to use the software which will help find bugs quicker and when the project is open-source, that user may be able to fix the bug for you. This helps software become much more usable and user-friendly quicker than otherwise.

## Linux License Justification
The GNU GPL License was chosen by Linus Torvalds for Linux when he created it. He did this because he was fed up with the MINIX programs not being free-software. Linus thought that there should be some complete unix-compatible software system that is free-software. The GNU GPL License requires all other projects built off of it to be open source as well. This is best for community involvement and sharing of all possible forks of the project, making it free-software. This license helped Linux pass MINIX as the most commonly used unix operating system due to it being free-software.
