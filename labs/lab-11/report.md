## Checkpoint 3: Curate some data
### Original Images
<img src="images/shoes.jpg">
<img src="images/jacket.jpg">
<img src="images/jeans.jpg">

### Formatted Images
<img src="images/shoes_formatted.jpg">
<img src="images/jacket_formatted.jpg">
<img src="images/jeans_formatted.jpg">

### Results
<img src="images/results.png">
The classifier was not able to classify the shoes correctly and thought they were a bag. This could be due to the orignal image being too small and not having enough data when being formatted even smaller.
